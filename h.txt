# M: First order of business! Structuring the objects we'll be using!
# E: :+1:
# E: Should we do a java and name everything in different files? Like a MinecraftObject.nim? Not used to how nim structures things so idk
# M: Ah fair, nah we can always move stuff to other files after ^^
# M: We'll also want 'base types' that can be inherited from, we'll be implementing MC Java's protocol on top of that ^^
# E: At some point we'll probably want to design a plugins system. Written in nim, ofc.
# M: Honestly with the callback system i think we should add for handling the protocol, it should implement itself in a way lmao
# M: But a dedicated API is defo super useful
# E: Also, we should keep these comments, very useful in future lmao

# M: Ehhhhhh, will they be useful?
# E: Probably lmao.
# E: We can always copy this to a txt file lmao
# M: True! But no idea who is who in the future lmao
